# Dream Connect Hub — Product & Field Specification

**Project:** Dream Enterprises LLC DBA Dream Puppies / Puppy Heaven
**Repo internal name:** dream-connect-hub
**Status:** Stable spec, post-Wave-A revision (2026-05-05)
**Authoritative for:** product decisions, surface inventory, field map, acknowledgment registry, payment method registry, PDF preconditions

> **Supersessions (May 2026)**
> This document consolidates and supersedes the three discovery artifacts produced on 2026-05-05 in the external `dream-connect-hub/docs/` folder (`discovery-current-state.md`, `field-flow-spec.md`, `reconciliation-summary.md`). Those artifacts remain as historical reference (Wave F2 still consumes the PDF field map from `field-flow-spec.md` Anchor A + B), but going forward this file is the canonical project spec.
>
> Differences vs. the original Cowork-session CLAUDE.md spec:
> - **Deposit amount:** original spec was 1/4 / 1/3 tiered. **Replaced with flat $300 default + per-puppy override** via `puppies.deposit_amount`. See `docs/status-enums.md` and Wave A2 of CLAUDE.md.
> - **Driver's-license collection at deposit time:** removed. Replaced with the existing 18+ acknowledgment (`ack_age_accuracy_at`) plus pickup-day ID verification (last-4 + state + expiration only) in Wave H4.
> - **Slot/placeholder mechanics on `upcoming_litters`:** retired in migration `20260505065200`. Upcoming litters are visibility/marketing only; reservations happen via `/request-deposit` → operator review → `/deposit?requestId=…`.

This spec is paired with [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) (the implementation plan) and [docs/status-enums.md](../status-enums.md) (the canonical status-column source of truth). When this spec and CLAUDE.md disagree, CLAUDE.md wins for *implementation* and this doc wins for *intent*.

## §1 — Resolved Product Decisions (21 OPDs)

All 21 open product decisions were resolved by the operator on 2026-05-05. These are canonical and supersede any prior ambiguity in code, schema, or PDF template.

### Business rules

| OPD | Topic | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OPD-01** | Deposit amount | **Flat $300 default**, with per-puppy override via `puppies.deposit_amount` (set by operator in OperatorReviewForm — Wave C). | ✅ Wave A2 — applied 2026-05-05 |
| **OPD-02** | Phone number | **Required** at both intake (`deposit_requests.customer_phone`) and formal agreement (`deposit_agreements.buyer_phone`). | ⏭ pending (Wave A continuation or Wave B) |
| **OPD-03** | Date of birth | **Omit** at deposit time. Keep the 18+ self-attestation checkbox (`ack_age_accuracy_at` / `ack_dep_6`). | ⏭ PDF-template edit (Wave B); no schema column needed. |
| **OPD-04** | Driver's License # | **Omit** from both deposit and purchase agreements. Pickup-day ID verification captures only last-4 + state + expiration (Wave H4). | ⏭ PDF-template edit; pickup capture in Wave H4 |
| **OPD-05** | Address format | **Split** into `buyer_street` / `buyer_city` / `buyer_state` / `buyer_zip` on `deposit_agreements`. Drop the `buyer_address` blob. ZIP enables sales-tax jurisdiction (OPD-15). | ⏭ Wave E (per CLAUDE.md) |
| **OPD-06** | How-Heard options | Canonical list: `instagram`, `facebook`, `facebook_marketplace`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `google`, `referral`, `previous_buyer`, `other`. Drop `bing`, `facebook_group`, `website_direct`, `referred_by_buyer` (folded into `referral`), `word_of_mouth` (folded into `referral`). | ⏭ Wave B |
| **OPD-07** | Section 3 questionnaire | **Digital, all 6 questions optional.** New nullable enum columns on `deposit_agreements`: `q_first_dog`, `q_living_situation`, `q_hours_alone`, `q_household_members`, `q_puppy_goal`, `q_training_experience`. | ⏭ Wave B / Wave E |
| **OPD-08** | Pickup preferences | **Full set:** primary date (required) + `pickup_time_preference`, `pickup_day_preference`, `pickup_alt_date`, `pickup_alt_time`, `pickup_alt_day`, `pickup_notes` (all optional). | ⏭ Wave E |
| **OPD-09** | Split payment | **Remove** the `split` method from code and schema. Multi-method scenarios handled manually by admin. | ✅ 2026-05-06 — applied via `20260506000004_drop_split_payment.sql`: drops `deposit_payment_detail` and `final_payment_detail` jsonb columns; rewrites the three CHECK constraints (`deposit_agreements.deposit_payment_method`, `deposit_agreements.final_payment_method_intended`, `final_sales.final_payment_method`) to exclude `'split'`. The discovery doc's reference to `split_payment_method_1/2` columns was incorrect — those columns never existed; the actual schema used `deposit_payment_detail jsonb`. |
| **OPD-10** | Deposit finalization rule | **Keep** code logic (three-condition gate: `buyer_signed_at` + `admin_signed_at` + `deposit_status='admin_confirmed'`). Tighten PDF Section 7 wording only. | ⏭ PDF-template edit |
| **OPD-11** | Deposit link URL | `${SITE_URL}/deposit?requestId=${request_id}` only. Drop the legacy `?litter=…` param — `DepositAgreement.tsx` resolves puppy_id vs litter_id from the request row. | ⏭ Wave B (token-gate `/deposit`) |
| **OPD-12** | Admin-initiated dialog | **Extend** `AdminInitiateDepositDialog.tsx` to support available puppies (currently litter-only). Adds an interest-type toggle matching the buyer-facing intake. | ⏭ Wave B/C |
| **OPD-13** | Seller selection | **Required** in admin dialog, defaults to logged-in user. CLR / YLR dropdown. | ⏭ Wave B/C |
| **OPD-14** | Employee # | **Drop** from PDF Section 8 (Office Use Only). The named-seller field already provides unique identification. | ⏭ PDF-template edit |
| **OPD-15** | Sales tax | **Display estimate** at agreement stage using `buyer_zip`. **Collect at final payment**, not at deposit. Florida: 6.5% Orange County combined; destination-based for NC. | ⏭ Wave B+ (depends on OPD-05) |
| **OPD-16** | Referral name | **Add** "Referred By (name):" line to PDF Section 2. Code's `how_heard_referral_name` field is correct; retain it. | ⏭ PDF-template edit |
| **OPD-17** | PDF generation pipeline | **Defer to Wave F.** Don't begin until (a) all OPD code/schema changes are stable, (b) PDF templates have AcroForm fields aligned to DB columns. | ⏭ Wave F |
| **OPD-18** | Purchase agreement | **Defer to post-Wave G.** Build the deposit workflow (Waves A–G) end-to-end first; purchase agreement becomes its own scoped wave. `final_sales` remains manually populated until then. | ⏭ Post-Wave-G |

### Infrastructure

| OPD | Topic | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OPD-19** | Admin RLS bug | The `admin_all_deposit_agreements` policy must check `profiles.user_id = auth.uid()`, not `profiles.id`. | ✅ Already fixed — live `pg_policy` query confirms `profiles.user_id` is in use (likely via migration `20260413000000_fix_rls_profiles_user_id.sql`). |
| **OPD-20** | Duplicate RLS policy | Drop `public_insert_deposit_agreements` (plural, permissive). Retain `public_insert_deposit_agreement` (singular, locked initial state). | ✅ Wave A6 — applied 2026-05-05 |
| **OPD-21** | 60-second public read policy | Original decision: keep until Wave D, then replace with token-based SELECT. **Superseded by Wave A6**, which dropped both out-of-migration policies (`public_insert_deposit_agreements` plural and `public_read_recent_deposit_agreements`) at the same time. The deposit submit success path uses writer's-own-row visibility on `INSERT … RETURNING`, which doesn't require the SELECT policy. Token-based SELECT still arrives in Wave D. | ✅ Wave A6 — applied 2026-05-05 |

---

## §2 — System surfaces (current state)

### Buyer-facing routes

| Route | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/request-deposit` | `src/pages/RequestDeposit.tsx` → `src/components/DepositRequestForm.tsx` | Public intake — buyer expresses interest. Writes `deposit_requests` row via the public-insert RLS policy. Not a legal agreement. |
| `/deposit` | `src/pages/DepositAgreement.tsx` → `src/components/deposit/DepositForm.tsx` | Formal legal agreement. **Wave B will gate this on a valid `?requestId=` (operator-issued link only).** Writes `deposit_agreements` via the strict singular `public_insert_deposit_agreement` policy. |
| `/payment/:agreementId/:buyerToken` | *(not yet built — Wave D)* | Buyer payment dashboard with attestation form. Authenticates via `buyer_access_token`. |
| `/agreements/:agreementId/:buyerToken/download` | *(not yet built — Wave F)* | Buyer-tokenized signed-agreement PDF download. |

### Admin-facing routes

| Route | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/deposit-requests` | `src/pages/admin/DepositRequests.tsx` + `DepositRequestDetailPanel.tsx` | Operator triage of intake submissions. Status filter badges, accept/decline actions, "Send Deposit Link" trigger. Wave C replaces the inline accept-flow with a structured `OperatorReviewForm`. |
| `/admin/agreements` | `src/pages/admin/AgreementsPage.tsx` + `AgreementDetailPanel.tsx` | Per-agreement actions: confirm payment, admin-sign, finalize, post-sale (puppy guide / testimonial), danger zone (reject / refund / cancel). Wave A2 removed the deposit-tier column. |
| `/admin/pickup/:agreementId` | *(not yet built — Wave H4)* | Pickup-day handover tablet flow with photo uploads + signature pad. |

### Edge functions

The 16 active edge functions, grouped by purpose:

**Deposit-flow notifications**
- `notify-deposit-request` — admin + buyer email on intake submit
- `notify-puppy-inquiry` — admin + buyer email on puppy-inquiry submit
- `notify-contact-message` — admin + buyer email on generic contact form
- `send-request-decision` — accept/decline buyer email
- `send-deposit-link` — emails the deposit URL to buyer (Wave B will switch to `?requestId=`-only format)
- `send-deposit-receipt` — buyer email after operator confirms payment

**Agreement lifecycle**
- `finalize-agreement` — admin-only; gates on `buyer_signed_at` + `admin_signed_at` + `deposit_status='admin_confirmed'`; transitions `agreement_status` to `admin_approved`. Wave F will trigger PDF generation here.

**Post-sale**
- `send-puppy-guide` — buyer email with care guide HTML (does not yet write `pet_guide_storage_path`)
- `send-testimonial-invite` — buyer email with review CTA
- `generate-training-plan` — admin trigger; emails plan HTML to buyer

**Operations**
- `send-pending-reminders` — hourly cron; flags agreements past reminder thresholds
- `send-newsletter` — admin-triggered marketing send
- *(plus 4 utility / admin-internal functions)*

**To be added by future waves**
- Wave D: `mark-payment-sent`, `submit-payment-attestation`
- Wave F: `generate-agreement-pdf`, `agreement-download-url`
- Wave H: `finalize-pickup-handover`, `generate-dispute-evidence-packet`

### Database schema

The full schema lives in `supabase/migrations/`. The canonical status enum source is [docs/status-enums.md](../status-enums.md). Key tables:

| Table | Purpose | Created in |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit_requests` | Public intake records | `20260414000000` |
| `deposit_agreements` | Legal agreement records | `20260410000000` (workflow), audited via `agreement_audit_log` from `20260411000003` |
| `puppies` | Inventory; `deposit_amount` column added in Wave A2 (`20260506000000`) for per-puppy override. | `supabase-schema.sql` (archived); subsequent ALTERs in migrations |
| `upcoming_litters` | Visibility/marketing only since `20260505065200` (slot/deposit machinery dissolved). | `20250225000000` |
| `payment_methods_config` | Seeded with 6 rows (zelle/venmo/cashapp/apple_pay/square/cash). **Handles are NULL — operator must populate.** See §3. | `20260410000000` |
| `final_sales` | Final-payment + pet-guide tracking. Manually populated in interim per OPD-18. | `20260410000000` |
| `agreement_audit_log` | Per-event audit trail. Service-role write only since `20260422000000`. | `20260411000003` |

### RLS — post-Wave-A6 state

`deposit_agreements` policies (live, verified 2026-05-05):
- `admin_all_deposit_agreements` — ALL — admin via `profiles.user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'`
- `public_insert_deposit_agreement` (singular) — INSERT — strict locked initial state per `20260422000000`

The two out-of-migration policies (`public_insert_deposit_agreements` plural, `public_read_recent_deposit_agreements`) were dropped in Wave A6.

`agreement_status` CHECK constraint (post-A5): `('sent','admin_approved','complete','cancelled')` — `'buyer_signed'` value retired; `buyer_signed_at` timestamp is the lifecycle marker.

### Email templates

All in `supabase/functions/_shared/email/templates.ts`. ~20 templates covering buyer-facing (deposit lifecycle, post-sale, training plan, newsletter) and admin-facing (new submissions, finalization, pending reminders, manual-review escalation). The deposit-link template's URL format changes in Wave B per OPD-11.

---

## §3 — Anchor A: Payment Method Registry

Source of truth: Deposit Agreement PDF Section 6. The `payment_methods_config` table will replace hard-coded handles when populated; **all 6 seeded rows currently have NULL `handle_or_recipient` values** — operator action required before buyers see correct handles in `PaymentMethodSelector`.

| Method Key | PDF Label | Handle / Contact | Account Type | Memo Required? | Confirmation Flow |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cashapp` | Cash App | `$LOSPHD` | Personal | ✅ | Manual admin confirm |
| `venmo` | Venmo | `@Dream_Enterprises_LLC` | Business | ✅ | Manual admin confirm |
| `apple_pay` | Apple Pay | `(407) 744-5855` | Personal phone | ✅ | Manual admin confirm |
| `zelle` | Zelle | `(407) 744-5855` or `clebronrivera@icloud.com` | Personal (may show as "Carlos Lebron") | ✅ | Manual admin confirm |
| `cash` | Cash — In Person | Arrange with seller | n/a | n/a | Preferred for safety; encouraged before pickup |
| `square` | Square (Credit/Debit) | Invoice link sent after form processed | Business | n/a | Tax auto-calculated at checkout; invoice sent manually |

**Memo format** (all non-Square): `[Full Legal Name] · [Phone Number] · [Deposit / Final Payment / Full Payment]`

**Wave H7** will add merchant-descriptor / handle-hygiene operator checklist work (e.g., setting Square's merchant descriptor to `DREAMPUPPIES 321-697-8864`). No code change there — checklist + verification only.

---

## §4 — Anchor B: Acknowledgment Registry

### B.1 — Deposit Agreement Acknowledgments (PDF Section 9 / Web `DepositForm.tsx`)

7 required boolean checkboxes; each captures a separate `ack_*_at` timestamp on `deposit_agreements`.

| Stable ID | PDF text (verbatim) | Web Form | DB column |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ack_dep_1` | "I have read and understand this entire Reservation & Deposit Agreement and agree to be bound by all of its terms." | ✅ | `ack_full_agreement_at` |
| `ack_dep_2` | "I understand that this $300 deposit is NON-REFUNDABLE except as expressly stated in the Deposit Terms above." | ✅ | *(non-refundable note in agreement terms; covered by `ack_full_agreement_at`)* |
| `ack_dep_3` | "I understand the pickup policy and will coordinate my pickup date with Dream Puppies as described." | ✅ | *(pickup terms; covered by `ack_full_agreement_at`)* |
| `ack_dep_4` | "I acknowledge that applicable sales tax will be calculated based on the transaction location and payment method, and will be collected at final payment." | ✅ | *(sales tax notice; covered by `ack_full_agreement_at`)* |
| `ack_dep_5` | "I understand my reservation is NOT confirmed until Dream Puppies has verified receipt of the $300 deposit and an authorized seller has countersigned." | ✅ | *(covered by `ack_full_agreement_at`)* |
| `ack_dep_6` | "I confirm I am at least 18 years of age and that all information I have provided is accurate and complete." | ✅ | `ack_age_accuracy_at` |
| `ack_dep_7` | "I understand my electronic or typed signature carries the same legal effect as a handwritten signature and is accepted as binding by both parties." | ✅ | `ack_esign_valid_at` |

The current code captures 7 separate timestamped acks: `ack_full_agreement_at`, `ack_statutory_rights_at`, `ack_esign_valid_at`, `ack_genetic_disclaimer_at`, `ack_arbitration_at`, `ack_age_accuracy_at`, `ack_welfare_responsibility_at`. **Wave E will add additional acks** (per Wave H6 contract clauses): payment authorization, identity attestation, pre-dispute contact, pickup acceptance, Florida venue.

The **arbitration typed phrase** (`arbitration_typed_phrase` / `arbitration_typed_at`) is captured in addition to the checkbox — required exact match to "I understand and agree to arbitration."

### B.2 — Purchase Agreement Acknowledgments (PDF Article IX) — Wave B scope

7 acks, none currently in web form or schema. All new columns added when the purchase agreement digital form is built.

| Stable ID | PDF text (verbatim) | Statutory link | Required level |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ack_pur_1` | "I have read and understand the full terms of this Agreement and agree to be bound by them." | — | Required |
| `ack_pur_2` | "I have reviewed my statutory rights regarding this pet purchase." | Fla. Stat. § 828.29 | Review |
| `ack_pur_3` | "I understand electronic signatures have the same legal force as handwritten signatures." | — | Review |
| `ack_pur_4` | "I acknowledge that canine genetic outcomes cannot be guaranteed per peer-reviewed science." | Axelsson et al. (2022) | Review |
| `ack_pur_5` | "I understand arbitration is required. I AM WAIVING MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND CLASS ACTION." | Fla. Stat. Ch. 682 | Required (typed phrase reused from deposit) |
| `ack_pur_6` | "I confirm I am at least 18 years of age and that all information I have provided is accurate." | — | Required |
| `ack_pur_7` | "I accept full responsibility for the Puppy's actions and welfare after the Transfer Date." | — | Required |

## §7 — PDF generation preconditions (Wave F)

The `signed_pdf_storage_path` column on `deposit_agreements` exists but is never written today. PDF generation is **not implemented** — no `pdf-lib`/`pdfkit`/equivalent dependency, no template files, no edge function. Wave F adds this pipeline.

Before Wave F begins, three preconditions:

**P1: PDF templates in final form.** DOB removed (OPD-03), DL# removed (OPD-04), How-Heard list updated (OPD-06), structured address layout (OPD-05), referral name field added (OPD-16), Employee # removed from Sec 8 (OPD-14), Sec 7 wording tightened (OPD-10). Templates must have **AcroForm named fields** aligned to the DB columns in §5 + §6.

**P2: PDF generation strategy.** Plan defaults to `pdf-lib` (form-fill via AcroForm) — fast, precise, requires template fields. Alternative: `puppeteer` (HTML → PDF) — no template changes but larger files and more styling complexity. Wave F is built around `pdf-lib`.

**P3: Storage bucket policy.** Signed PDFs contain PII (name, address). Bucket has no public read; admin-only direct read; buyer access via short-lived (1 hr) signed URLs minted by the `agreement-download-url` edge function (Wave F6). Buyer-facing route: `/agreements/:agreementId/:buyerToken/download`.

**Do not begin Wave F until Waves A, B, and E are stable and the two PDF templates are finalized.** Building against an unstable data model means rebuilding after every wave.

## §8 — Implementation pointer

The wave-by-wave implementation plan lives at [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). It defines eight sequential waves (A–H) covering audit/cleanup, token-gating, operator review form, buyer payment dashboard, schema completeness, PDF generation, tests/docs, and chargeback-defense / pickup handover.

**Wave status (post 2026-05-05):** A1–A6 done. A7+A8 in progress. B onward pending. Refer to CLAUDE.md for the live wave checklist.
